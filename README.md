# Membership Due Calculator

A JAR application built using Java and JavaFX that calculates the membership dues assessed for the members of an electric cooperative. 
Dues are assessed in equal proportions on three components: **equal payment**, the **number of electric meters served**, and **revenue minus cost of power**.
 <br /><br /><br />
The application gives users the option to choose between three main functions.

For more information behind the calculation of dues assessed per component, please refer to the Eclipse source code of the project `DueCalculator/src/`.
<br /><br />

The `DueCalculator.jar` is a runnable JAR file of the application. It scans in `duesData.txt`, a file of membership information used to calculate dues. 
The `duesData.txt` file is populated with placeholder data in order to demonstrate the functionality of the `DueCalculator.jar` application.
