# Membership Due Calculator

A JAR application built using Java and JavaFX that calculates the membership dues assessed for the members of an electric cooperative. 
Dues are assessed in equal proportions on three components: **equal payment**, the **number of electric meters served**, and **revenue minus cost of power**.
 <br /><br /><br />
The application gives users the option to choose between three main functions.

The Eclipse source code of the project can be found in `DueCalculator/src/`. The `DueCalculator.jar` is a runnable JAR file of the application. It scans in 
`duesdata.txt`, a data file of membership information used to calculate dues. However, this data file has not been provided due to privacy concerns.
